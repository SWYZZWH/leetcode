# Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
# sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
# transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or
# another computer environment.
#
#  Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no
# restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You
# just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this
# string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
#
#  Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode
# serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be
# creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
#
#
#  Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
# Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
#
#
#  Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = []
# Output: []
#
#
#
#  Constraints:
#
#
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10‚Å¥].
#  -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
