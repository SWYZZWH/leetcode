# Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome.
#
#
#  Example 1:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
# Output: true
#
#
#  Example 2:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,2]
# Output: false
#
#
#
#  Constraints:
#
#
#  The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10‚Åµ].
#  0 <= Node.val <= 9
#
#
#
# Follow up: Could you do it in
# O(n) time and
# O(1) space?
